# autonomous-network-security-agent
Build an AI agent that proactively defends a network by predicting, detecting, and neutralizing advanced persistent threats (APTs). The agent operates autonomously, continuously analyzing network patterns for anomalies. When a threat is found, it automatically deploys countermeasures, patches vulnerabilities, and quarantines systems.
